* the pageNavigation is not in the center of the window when using safari (mobile), firefox or microsoft edge. 
* css for the about (or the "?") button
* remove rounded corners of the searchButton when using safari mobile (solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5263260/stop-safari-mobile-from-giving-input-buttons-rounded-corners)
* make sure choose_set.php validates!!  

suggestions:
* scroll to search results, either using hash or something else. needs to be a smooth scroll and not an instant jump!

small changes/bugs:
* would be nice to autofucus when the entered keyword doesn't match anything on the Lego database. (possible solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5629684/how-to-check-if-element-exists-in-the-visible-dom)
* make the animation for the warningButton smooth on fadeOut. (bug lies in the need to make it "display = 'none'".





fixed:
* fix autofocus for certain URL's
* change the names of variables to english in "searchtab.js"
* change names of all files to english
* make sure the animations work for all browsers using -webkit- etc.. and this needs to validate (fixed by doing this in javascript instead of css) 
* change to "This set consists of:" instead of "This item consists of:" on inventory_set.php (example: http://www.student.itn.liu.se/~isaen688/tnmk30/Projekt/LEGO-projekt/inventory_set.php?SetID=4789-1 )
