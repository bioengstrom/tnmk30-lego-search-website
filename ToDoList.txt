* the pageNavigation is not in the center of the window when using safari mobile or firefox
* css for the about (or the "?") button
* change names of all files so to english
* make sure the animations work for all browsers using -webkit- etc.. and this needs to validate!!
* remove rounded corners of the searchButton when using safari mobile (solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5263260/stop-safari-mobile-from-giving-input-buttons-rounded-corners)

suggestions:
* scroll to search results, either using hash or something else. needs to be a smooth scroll and not an instant jump!

small changes:
* would be nice to autofucus when the entered keyword doesn't match anything on the Lego database.
* make the animation for the warningButton smooth on fadeOut. (bug lies in the need to make it "display = 'none'".





fixed:
* fix autofocus for certain URL's
* change the names of variables to english in "searchtab.js"
